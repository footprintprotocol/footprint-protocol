# Footprint Protocol Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned development phases of Footprint Protocol.  
It is indicative and subject to change as the protocol evolves.

---

## Phase 1 — Foundation & Documentation

Focus: Concept validation and transparency

- Public release of protocol documentation
- Whitepaper publication
- Tokenomics definition (non-governance, fixed supply)
- Landing page content preparation
- GitHub repository setup and structure
- Community feedback collection on protocol concept

Status: In progress

---

## Phase 2 — Data Indexing & Observation Layer

Focus: Core functionality (non-public logic)

- On-chain data indexing for Terra Classic
- Funding source observation framework
- Behavioral sequence detection
- Initial footprint clustering logic
- Internal dashboards for data validation

Note:  
Core indexing and detection methodologies remain non-public to preserve system integrity.

---

## Phase 3 — User Interface & Access Layer

Focus: Controlled user access

- Public dashboard (read-only views)
- Advanced analytics gated via $FOOT utility
- Behavioral alerts and notifications
- API access for third-party tools
- Performance optimization and scalability testing

---

## Phase 4 — Ecosystem Expansion

Focus: Modular growth

- Cosmos ecosystem compatibility
- Cross-chain data architecture research
- Additional behavioral models
- Developer tooling and integrations

---

## Guiding Principles

- No identity attribution
- No labeling or enforcement
- No governance power tied to token ownership
- Transparency without coercion
- Utility-driven token design

---

## Disclaimer

This roadmap does not constitute a commitment to deliver specific features at fixed dates.  
Development priorities may evolve based on technical constraints, security considerations, and community feedback.
