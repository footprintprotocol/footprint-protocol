On-chain observation protocol for funding sources and behavioral patterns
# 👣 Footprint Protocol

On-chain footprints never disappear.

Footprint Protocol is an on-chain observation protocol designed to visualize funding sources and repeating behavioral patterns across wallets on the Terra Classic blockchain.

Footprint does not identify individuals, label scams, or assign intent.  
It simply shows what the chain already records — behavior and origin.

## 🔍 What Is Footprint?

Footprint Protocol focuses on a simple idea:

> Wallets can be replaced.  
> Behaviors leave footprints.

In permissionless systems, users can create unlimited wallets.  
While identities reset, patterns do not.

Footprint makes those patterns visible.

## 🎯 The Problem

Most blockchain analytics tools are wallet-centric.

This creates a blind spot:
- The same funding source can create multiple wallets
- Repeated project launches can occur from fresh addresses
- Harmful behaviors can reset by opening new wallets

**The issue is not anonymity.  
The issue is invisible repetition.**

## 🧠 The Footprint Approach

Footprint does not track *who* acts.  
It tracks how actions occur and where funds originate.

### Core concepts:
- Funding Source Tracking  
  Identifies known funding origins (e.g. centralized exchange hot wallets)

- Behavioral Footprints  
  Observes action sequences such as:
  - Funding → staking
  - Funding → token deployment
  - Liquidity provision and removal
  - Proposal-related stake movements

- Footprint Clusters  
  When multiple wallets share similar funding origins, action sequences, and timing patterns, they form a behavioral cluster.

Clusters represent repeated behavior, not identity.

## 🚫 What Footprint Is NOT

Footprint Protocol is intentionally limited.

It is not:
- ❌ A scam detection system
- ❌ An identity or ownership attribution tool
- ❌ A reputation or scoring mechanism
- ❌ Financial or investment advice

Footprint does not accuse, judge, or label.

## 🪙 $FOOT Token

$FOOT is a utility access token.

It does not provide:
- Governance power
- Voting rights
- Enforcement or penalty mechanisms

The token is used exclusively for access to:
- Advanced footprint visualizations
- Funding source cluster analysis
- Custom alerts and behavior notifications
- API access for dashboards and analytics tools

Token = deeper visibility, not authority.

---

## 🌐 Network Scope

- Initial deployment: Terra Classic
- Designed for expansion across the Cosmos ecosystem
- Chain-agnostic behavior analysis is a long-term goal

---

## ⚖️ Transparency & Disclaimer

Footprint Protocol:
- Uses only publicly available on-chain data
- Does not identify individuals
- Does not label scams or provide risk ratings
- Leaves interpretation and decision-making entirely to the user

---

## 👣 Vision

In decentralized systems, accountability does not come from identity.  
It comes from patterns that cannot be erased.

Footprint Protocol exists to make those patterns visible — nothing more.

---

## 📌 Status

Footprint Protocol is currently under active development.

This repository contains:
- Concept documentation
- Whitepaper drafts
- Tokenomics
- Product narrative

Core indexing logic and detection methodologies are intentionally not public at this stage.
