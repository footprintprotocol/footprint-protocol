Footprint Protocol

On-chain footprints never disappear.

Footprint Protocol is an on-chain observation protocol that visualizes funding sources and recurring behavioral patterns across blockchain wallets.

It does not identify individuals.
It does not label scams.
It does not assign intent.

It shows what the chain already records.

What Is Footprint?

In permissionless blockchains, anyone can create unlimited wallets.
Identity can be reset instantly.

Behavior cannot.

Footprint Protocol shifts analysis from wallets to behavioral continuity by observing:
 • Where funds originate
 • How actions are structured
 • When behaviors repeat

⸻

Why Footprint Exists

Most analytics tools treat wallets as isolated entities.

This creates blind spots:
 • The same funding source can repeatedly seed new wallets
 • Identical action sequences can be reproduced with fresh addresses
 • Reputation resets are trivial

Footprint addresses this gap by making repeated behavior visible without breaking anonymity.

What Footprint Observes

Funding Source Continuity

Footprint tracks the origin of funds used to initialize wallets and perform actions, including known exchange sources and first-hop transfers.

Behavioral Sequences

Instead of single transactions, Footprint observes action flows such as:
 • Funding followed by token deployment
 • Liquidity provision followed by withdrawal
 • Repeated stake and proposal-related movements

Footprint Clusters

When multiple wallets share similar funding origins, timing, and action sequences, they form a footprint cluster.

Clusters represent behavioral models, not identities.

What Footprint Does Not Do

Footprint Protocol does not:
 • Identify wallet owners
 • Label scams or bad actors
 • Assign risk scores or reputation
 • Enforce rules or penalties
 • Provide financial or investment advice

All data is descriptive.
All interpretation belongs to the user.

Token Utility: $FOOT

$FOOT is a utility access token.

It is used to unlock:
 • Advanced behavioral visualizations
 • Extended historical analysis
 • Custom alerts and notifications
 • API access for analytics tools

$FOOT does not provide governance power, control, or authority over the protocol.

Total supply is fixed at 1,000,000,000 $FOOT.

⸻

Network Scope

Footprint Protocol initially focuses on Terra Classic.

The architecture is designed to be:
 • Modular
 • Cosmos-compatible
 • Expandable to additional chains in future phases

⸻

Transparency by Design

Footprint Protocol operates exclusively on publicly available on-chain data.
 • No off-chain data
 • No identity inference
 • No subjective labeling

Transparency is achieved without coercion.

⸻

Current Status

Footprint Protocol is under active development.

Publicly available:
 • Protocol documentation
 • Whitepaper
 • Roadmap

Core indexing and detection methodologies are intentionally non-public at this stage.

Website features and dashboards are coming in later phases.

Disclaimer

Footprint Protocol does not identify individuals, label scams, or provide financial advice.
All insights are derived from publicly accessible blockchain data.
